# SNOOPSET
Software Lifecycle Policies Collectors

Here, a set of web crawlers in charge of retrieving sofware lifecycle policies for further data manipulation (i.e., [snooplab](http://snooplab.alien6.com)). Each of them is self-contained and can be run through his own Docker container.

Don't hesitate to contribute.
